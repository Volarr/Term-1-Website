# Term-1-Website
This is my Secondary 4 website project throughout the year.
The purpose of this project is to create a website that serves as a homework site to the students in my class. THey will all have accounts for the website and will be able to edit the homework due. If they start fooling around with the website, I can take away their rights to edit anything and they will only be able to view the pages. I have finished creating all the pages and styling for the pages and am now working on creating the accounts for all the students.
